      map_fn: A callable to execute on each element in 'nested'.
      nested: A potentially nested combination of sequence objects. Sequence
        objects include tuples, lists, namedtuples, and all subclasses of
        collections.Sequence except strings. See nest.is_sequence for details.
        For example [1, ('hello', 4.3)] is a nested structure containing elements
        1, 'hello', and 4.3.
    Returns:
      out_structure: A potentially nested combination of sequence objects with the
        same structure as the 'nested' input argument. out_structure
        contains the result of applying map_fn to each element in 'nested'. For

        need to have the same rank, but their rank must not be dynamic.
      multiples: A python list of ints indicating how to tile each Tensor
        in 'tensors'. Similar to the 'multiples' argument to tf.tile.
    Returns:
      tiled_tensors: A potentially nested tuple or list of Tensors with the same
        structure as the 'tensors' input argument. Contains the result of
        applying tf.tile to each Tensor in 'tensors'. When the rank of a Tensor
        in 'tensors' is greater than the length of multiples, multiples is padded
        at the end with 1s. For example when tiling a 4-dimensional Tensor with
        multiples [3, 4], multiples would be padded to [3, 4, 1, 1] before tiling.
